SAVEOURWATER.GBA

Hello, earthling.
Your planet, in case you have not noticed, is going through some concerning issues regarding climate change. 
I understand that the issue may or may not be "imaginary" depending on your social and political standing, so, steering slightly away from climate, we will deal with the known and unavoidable fact that human waste has killed and hurt marine life a great deal in the past. A large portion of this waste is made up of plastic bags.

This game is about saving our water.

Some nice facts before you play this game:
1) Billions of pounds of plastic can be found in our oceans.
1) Most plastics are not bio-degradable. 
2) Animals live in the ocean.
3) They don't like our bags/waste either.

Some nice assumptions you'll make for the game:
1) You are a bird.
2) Plastic bags fly vertically into the ocean.
3) Your life's only purpose is to stop these plastic bags from entering the sea.
4) You stop them by colliding with them (If you're confused as to how this is possible, when I play the game I like to think my beak disintegrates the bags with my super-beak-chemicals. So you just need to have an open-mind, be imaginative.)
5) The world is depending on you, Bird!!!! Humans suck but think about your fellow birds (who are no where to be found - you are a lone ranger).

How to play:
Fly around using the arrow keys, and get as many plastic bags as you can before they hit the water. You will deal with one at a time. The game ends when a plastic bag falls into the sea.

1) Up button moves you upwards
2) Down button moves your downwards
3) Left button moves you leftwards 
4) Right button moves your rightwards
5) Select button takes you back to the introduction (like a restart)
6) Start button (or enter) starts the game ----- you'll know when you'll need to use this.
7) Spacebar speedens up the emulator if you want to skip some of the images at the beginning and end. 

Ok.
Good Luck.
